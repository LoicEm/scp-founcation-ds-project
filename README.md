This are my first step in working with data from the [SCP Foundation wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/)

## What is SCP Foundation ?

(Copied from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation))

The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs). The real-world website is community-based and includes elements of many genres such as horror, science fiction, and urban fantasy.

On the SCP Foundation wiki, the majority of works consist of "special containment procedures": structured internal documentation that describes an SCP object and the means of keeping it contained. The website also contains thousands of "Foundation Tales", short stories set within the universe of the SCP Foundation. The series has been praised for its ability to convey horror through its scientific and academic writing style, as well as for its high standards of quality. 

## A rich source of high-quality fictional work

## My immediate next steps

- Finish the scraper
- Data analysis on tags and content

### Ideas for further down the road

- A model to predict tags
- A model to detect plagiarism
- A generative model to write articles
- A generative models to build illustrations from an article.
